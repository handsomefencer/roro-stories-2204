# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

Softare is hard. It is complicated. Sometimes working on it is fun, like when we solve a problem for another person with it, and other times painful, like when we spend all day failing to fix a bug.  

Software makes me feel dumb every day. 

### Things that help 

* When people don't assume things about me because of my age, body size, disabilities, ethnicity, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, gender identity and expression, or sexual identity and orientation.
* Use welcoming and inclusive language.
* When you avoid describing something as 'simple' or 'easy.' 
  * If it was simple or easy I would have figured it out already.
  * If it was simple or easy then I must be dumb.
* When you focus on your privilege instead of that in others.
* When you tell me what you think my question is before answering.
* When you assume everybody has a [positive intent](https://archive.fortune.com/galleries/2008/fortune/0804/gallery.bestadvice.fortune/7.html).
* When you give genuine compliments to others:
  * Tell them what they did
  * Tell them why it was special or unexpected
  * Tell them how it made you feel
* When you write a user story from the perspective of someone with a different pronoun
* When you understand we all want the same things for ourselves, our families, and other people even if we may disagree with the politics of how to get them
* When you invert and play with stereotypes

### Criticism
* Ask before offering it.
* listen to and understand it before accepting or rejecting it.
* Accept that sometimes it will be rejected.
* Show that you understand it before explaining why you reject it.

* Make jokes about things I'm not sensitive bout.
* Don't make jokes about things a reasonable person might guess I'm sensitive about.
* Make fun of me for things I can change.
* Don't make fun of me for things I can't change.
