# Code of Conduct

Sometimes working on software is fun, like when we solve a problem for another person; but other times it can be painful, like when I spend all day or all week failing to fix a bug. Software makes me feel dumb every day and I don't want this project to make a contributor feel dumb. 

### Things that help me have fun, even when I feel dumb

* When people don't assume things about me because I'm old, because I sometimes get pimples, because I'm a doughy, because I don't have a CS degree, because I'm not very good as a developer even though I've been at it professionally for more than a decade, because I don't have kids, because I'm shitty at relationships, because I suck at business, because I have a messed up back, because I'm white, because of my mustachio, because I'm straight, or because I'm insanely proud to be an American and a veteran and a former Army Ranger. 

* When people avoid describing something to me as 'simple' or 'easy.' If it was simple or easy I would have figured it out already; if it was simple or easy then I must be dumb.

* When people focus on their own privilege instead of bitching about the privilege of others.

* When you tell me what you think my question is before answering.

* When you assume everybody has a [positive intent](https://archive.fortune.com/galleries/2008/fortune/0804/gallery.bestadvice.fortune/7.html).

* When you give genuine compliments to others telling them what exactly they did, why you found it special or unexpected, and how what they did made you feel.

* When you write a user story from the perspective of someone with a different pronoun.

* When you understand we all want the same things for ourselves, our families, and other people even if we may disagree with the politics of how to get them.

* When you invert and play with stereotypes

### Criticism

Ask before offering criticism. Listen to and understand criticism before accepting or rejecting it. Accept that sometimes your criticism will be rejected. Show that you understand criticism before explaining why you reject it. 

## Teasing or joking

Teasing and joking can make things fun. Other times it can make people feel less than. Make fun of me for things I can change; don't make fun of me for things I can't.
